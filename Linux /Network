2 {

	1. Verify whether dhclient is running.
	    ps ax | grep dhclient
	2. Display your current ip address(es).
	    ifconfig
	3. Display the configuration file where this ip address is defined.
	    cat /etc/network/interfaces
	4. Follow the nic configuration in the book to change your ip address from dhcp client to fixed. Keep the same ip address to avoid      	   conflicts!
	    sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces

	    # interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)
	    auto lo
	    iface lo inet loopback

	    auto  eth0
	    iface eth0 inet static
	    address   172.20.51.62
	    broadcast 172.20.51.255
	    netmask   255.255.255.0
	    gateway   172.20.51.1
	5. Did you also configure the correct gateway in the previous question ? If not, then do this now.
	    gateway 172.20.51.1
	6. Verify that you have a gateway.
	    route
	7. Verify that you can connect to the gateway, that it is alive.
	    ping 172.20.51.1
	8. Change the last two digits of your mac address.
	    sudo ifconfig enp2s0 hw ether d4:3d:7e:b3:47:bb
	9. Which ports are used by http, pop3, ssh, telnet, nntp and ftp ?
	    cat /etc/services | grep ftp
	10. Explain why e-mail and websites are sent over tcp and not udp.
	    tcp֊ն udp֊ից տարբերվում է նրանով, որ tcp֊ն ինֆորմացիայի կորուստ թույլ չի տալիս, իտարբերություն udp֊ի։ Իսկ քանի որ Էլ․   		       փոստը տվյալների կորուստ չպիտի ունենա, այդ իսկ պատճառով էլ օգտագործում են tcp֊ն։
	11. Display the hostname of your computer.
	    hostname
	12. Which ip-addresses did your computer recently have contact with ?
	    arp -a
}


5 {

	1. Install sshd on the server.
	    sudo apt install ssh
	2. Verify in the ssh configuration files that only protocol version 2 is allowed.
	    grep Protocol /etc/ssh/ssh_config
	3. Use ssh to log on to the server, show your current directory and then exit the server.
	    ssh student@<ip>
	    pwd
	    exit
	4. Use scp to copy a file from your computer to the server.
	    scp <file> student@<ip>:<directory>
	5. Use scp to copy a file from the server to your computer.
	    scp student@<ip>:<file> <directory>
	6. (optional, only works when you have a graphical install of Linux) Install the xeyes package
	   on the server and use ssh to run xeyes on the server, but display it on your client.

	7. (optional, same as previous) Create a bookmark in firefox, then quit firefox on client and
	   server. Use ssh -X to run firefox on your display, but on your neighbour's computer. Do you
	   see your neighbour's bookmark ?

	8. Use ssh-keygen to create a key pair without passphrase. Setup passwordless ssh between
	   you and your neighbour. (or between your client and your server)

	9. Verify that the permissions on the server key files are correct; world readable for the public
	   keys and only root access for the private keys.
	    ls -l /etc/ssh/
	10. Verify that the ssh-agent is running.
	    ps -ef | grep ssh-agent
	11. (optional) Protect your keypair with a passphrase, then add this key to the ssh-agent
	    and test your passwordless ssh to the server.
}


6 {

	1. Create two directories with some files. Use nfs to share one of them as read only, the other
	   must be writable. Have your neighbour connect to them to test.
	    cd ~/Desktop
	    mkdir a,b
	    cd a
	    touch a.txt
	    cd ../b
	    touch b.txt
	    sudo vim /etc/exports
	    ~/Desktop/a/a.txt (ro)
	    ~/Desktop/b/b.txt (rw)
	    for test -> mount -t nfs <ip>:~/Desktop/a ~/Desktop/b /mnt
	2. Investigate the user owner of the files created by your neighbour.

	3. Protect a share by ip-address or hostname, so only your neighbour can connect.
	    ~/Desktop/a/a.txt student(rw)
}


10 {

	1. Install bind9 and verify with a sniffer how it works.
	    sudo apt-get install bind9 bind9utils bind9-doc
	4. Use dig and nslookup to verify your NS and A records.
	    dig
}
